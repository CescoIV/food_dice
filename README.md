## Food Dice

Have you ever had a problem looking for a place to eat? With Food Dice, you can simply let the application know where you are and what you are craving and it spits out a randomized, cut down list of places to eat.  Stuck in a rut??  You can also completely randomize what the application returns to you and have a brand new dining experience!

## How It Works

When you go to our website: https://food-dice.herokuapp.com/

It will take you to our log-in page:

Once you log in, it will take you to a page to add your location and your desired food type category.

You can even add more categories and it will spit out 3 restaurants within your categories.

Our application will give help you with your indecisiveness by spitting out 3 within your search area.

If you are even more indecisive and you just don't care about the type of food, you can click the "Don't Even Care" button and it will spit out one restaurant for you!
